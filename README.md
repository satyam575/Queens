## ðŸ“¸ How It Works

1. You take a screenshot of the Queens board.
2. Open the app âž” Select the image via file picker.
3. The app:
   - Detects the board's outer rectangle.
   - Divides it into a 9x9 grid.
   - Samples center colors to map regions.
   - Solves the Queens puzzle based on constraints:
     - One Queen per row
     - One Queen per column
     - No diagonal attacks
     - One Queen per color region
4. Solution is **instantly shown** in a neat popup window!

## ðŸš€ Future Scope

- [ ] Handle rotated board screenshots (detect skew, correct perspective).
- [ ] Add option to save solution image to disk.
- [ ] Make board size configurable (e.g., 8x8, 10x10).
- [ ] Bundle OpenCV native DLL inside the JAR for cleaner packaging.
- [ ] Create a full Windows Installer (Setup.exe) for easy distribution.
- [ ] Add "Save As..." option after showing solution popup.
- [ ] Support animated solving (step-by-step queen placement visualization).
- [ ] Build a web-based version (SpringBoot + React).
